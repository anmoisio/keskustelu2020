utils/dict_dir_add_pronprobs.sh: number of lines differs from data/local/dict_morph/lexicon.txt 42700 vs data/local/dict_morph/lexiconp.txt 56038
Probably something went wrong (e.g. input prons were generated from a different lexicon
than data/local/dict_morph_nosp, or you used pron_counts.txt when you should have used pron_counts_nowb.txt
or something else.  Make sure the prons in data/local/dict_morph_nosp/lexicon.txt exp/chain/tdnn7q_sp/decode_devel_morph_nosp/pron_counts.txt look
the same.
